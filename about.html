<p>I am a father, husband and a tech enthusiast. I love music, movies, books, riding bikes, running, playing guitar and coffee (not necessarily in that order).</p>

<p>I am a Mexican currently living in Wisconsin, US. I am a technical lead for Dextra Technologies. I have been working mostly with Microsoft technologies for the past 10 years.</p>

<p>This blog is intended to be a memory dump for things I am currently learning or thinking about. These opinions and thoughts are my own.</p>
