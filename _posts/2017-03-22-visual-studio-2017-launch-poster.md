On March 8th, Microsoft had their [Visual Studio 2017 launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra3Pd8KoVOw). A couple days after that, the Visual Studio Team posted the [Visual Studio 2017 poster](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/03/13/visual-studio-2017-poster/). Among other things, I noticed a small section with some Git commands:

While there are a ton of Git cheat sheets out there, I particularly like this one because it fits my usual workflow the best (probably because of years of using TFS version control).

Enjoy ;)
